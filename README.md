# stroff
I'd just like to intrject for a moment.
What you're referring to as stroff, is in fact, st-roff, or as I've recently taken to calling it, stroff ([/ɛs:ti:rɔff/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) s-t-roff).  
Roff is not a complete typesetting system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning ST system made useful by the ST macros, preprocessors and vital components comprising a full typesetting system as defined by POSIX.
